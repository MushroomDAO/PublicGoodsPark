# 09. Academic Support & Theoretical Foundation

"Public Goods Garden" (Park) isn't just a product; it is a practical implementation of several critical economic and sociological theories. This document outlines the academic foundations that validate our design choices.

## 📚 1. Digital Labor & Data Ownership
**Core Concept**: Users and creators are the true source of value in digital platforms, yet they are rarely compensated.
**Project Application**: The **Protocol Layer (Royalty)** and **Ticket System** are designed to capture and redistribute this value back to the creators.

### Key References
*   **Glen Weyl & Eric Posner - *Radical Markets* (2018)**
    *   **Theory: "Data as Labor"**. They argue that data generated by users is a form of labor that powers AI and digital services. Currently, this is treated as "ghost work" or raw material for platform monopolies.
    *   **Our Solution**: Park treats every API call and Protocol interaction as "Labor" that deserves a "Wage" (in the form of Protocol Revenue share from Ticket Burns), transforming "Ghost Work" into recognized contribution.
*   **Jaron Lanier - *Who Owns the Future?* (2013)**
    *   **Theory: "Micropayments"**. Lanier proposed a system where individuals receive nanopayments for the data they contribute to the cloud.
    *   **Our Solution**: The **Ticket (SBT)** system is an implementation of this. Each usage burns a tiny portion of a ticket, effectively streaming value (micropayments) to the builders of the underlying services.
*   **Shoshana Zuboff - *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* (2019)**
    *   **Theory: "Behavioral Surplus"**. She critiques how big tech mines human experience as free raw material for behavioral prediction products.
    *   **Our Solution**: By mandating a "Paid" model (Ticket) instead of an "Ad-Supported" model, we align incentives. Users pay for service, not with their privacy.

## 🤝 2. Social Capital & Trust
**Core Concept**: Capital is not just financial; it is also social. Networks of trust reduce transaction costs and foster cooperation.
**Project Application**: **Contribution Points (CP)** and **Soulbound Tokens (SBT)** are the accounting systems for Social Capital.

### Key References
*   **Pierre Bourdieu - *The Forms of Capital* (1986)**
    *   **Theory**: Bourdieu defined Social Capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships."
    *   **Our Solution**: The **Park ID (SBT)** objectifies this capital. A "Level 2 Ranger" status is not bought with money; it is earned through relationships and proven contribution, adhering to Bourdieu’s view that social capital takes time to accumulate.
*   **Robert Putnam - *Bowling Alone* (2000)**
    *   **Theory**: Putnam highlighted the decline of community networks (social capital) and its negative impact on democracy and efficiency.
    *   **Our Solution**: The specific design of the **"First 100 Users"** logic (Human-to-Human verification) forces the rebuilding of these community links, combating the atomization of digital life.
*   **Francis Fukuyama - *Trust* (1995)**
    *   **Theory**: High-trust societies have lower transaction costs and higher prosperity.
    *   **Our Solution**: The **Vault's** automated rules and the **Gatekeeper** middleware reduce the need for interpersonal trust by embedding "Spontaneous Sociability" into the code, lowering the friction for strangers to collaborate.

## 🌲 3. Governing the Digital Commons
**Core Concept**: Public goods (Commons) can be managed sustainably by communities without central coercion or privatization.
**Project Application**: The **Three-Layer Architecture** and **Vault Regulation** are direct applications of Polycentric Governance.

### Key References
*   **Elinor Ostrom - *Governing the Commons* (1990)**
    *   **Theory**: Challenged the "Tragedy of the Commons." She proved that "Common-Pool Resources" (CPRs) can be stable if managed by clearly defined communities with graduated sanctions.
    *   **Our Solution**:
        *   **Principle 1 (Boundaries)**: The **Whitelist/Ticket** creates a clear boundary between the Park and the outside world.
        *   **Principle 2 (Congruence)**: The **Vault** adjusts inflow/outflow (mining rewards) to match local conditions (system health).
        *   **Principle 3 (Sanctions)**: The **Dispute Resolution** flow provides the graduated sanctions Ostrom deems essential.
*   **Nick Srnicek - *Platform Capitalism* (2016)**
    *   **Theory**: Analyzed how platforms survive by extracting data and enforcing monopoly (Network Effects).
    *   **Our Solution**: We position Park as "Anti-Platform." By separating the **Infra (Bus)** from the **App (Taxi)**, we prevent the infrastructure provider from capturing all the value, allowing for a "Post-Platform" cooperative economy.
